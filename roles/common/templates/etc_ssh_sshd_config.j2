# This is the ssh server system-wide configuration file.
# See sshd_config(5) for more information on any settings used. Comments will be added only to clarify why a configuration was chosen.
#
# Created for OpenSSH v5.9

# Basic configuration
# ===================

# Enable/disable root login
PermitRootLogin {{ ssh_permit_root_login }}

# Define which port sshd should listen to.
Port 22

# Address family should always be limited to the active network configuration.
AddressFamily inet

# Define which addresses sshd should listen to. Default to `0.0.0.0`, ie make sure you put your desired address in here, since otherwise sshd will listen to everyone.
ListenAddress 0.0.0.0

# List HostKeys here.
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key

# Security configuration
# ======================

# Set the protocol version to 2 for security reasons. Disables legacy support.
Protocol 2

# Make sure sshd checks file modes and ownership before accepting logins. This prevents accidental misconfiguration.
StrictModes yes

# Logging, obsoletes QuietMode and FascistLogging
SyslogFacility AUTH
LogLevel {{ ssh_log_level }}

# Cryptography
# ------------

# **Ciphers**
Ciphers aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

# **Hash algorithms**
MACs {{ ssh_hmacs | join(',') }}

# **Key Exchange Algorithms**
KexAlgorithms {{ ssh_kexalgorithms | join(',') }}

# Authentication
# --------------

PermitUserEnvironment no
LoginGraceTime 30s

# Allow client to pass locale environment variables
AcceptEnv LANG LC_*

# Specifies  the  maximum  number  of authentication attempts permitted per connection.
# Once the number of failures reaches half this value, additional failures are logged.
# Causes 'Too Many Authentication Failures' error when set to a low value and the user tries several keys.
MaxAuthTries 5
MaxSessions 10
MaxStartups 10:30:100

# Enable public key authentication
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Reject keys that are explicitly blacklisted
RevokedKeys /etc/ssh/revoked_keys

# Never use host-based authentication. It can be exploited.
IgnoreRhosts yes
IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes
HostbasedAuthentication no

# Enable PAM to enforce system wide rules
UsePAM yes

# Enable/disable password-based authentication, which can make brute-force attacks easier
PasswordAuthentication {{ ssh_password_authentication }}
PermitEmptyPasswords no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# Only enable Kerberos authentication if it is configured.
KerberosAuthentication no
KerberosOrLocalPasswd no
KerberosTicketCleanup yes
#KerberosGetAFSToken no

# Only enable GSSAPI authentication if it is configured.
GSSAPIAuthentication no
GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

# Network
# -------

# Disable TCP keep alive since it is spoofable. Use ClientAlive messages instead, they use the encrypted channel
TCPKeepAlive no

# Manage `ClientAlive..` signals via interval and maximum count. This will periodically check up to a `..CountMax` number of times within `..Interval` timeframe, and abort the connection once these fail.
ClientAliveInterval 600
ClientAliveCountMax 3

# Disable tunneling
PermitTunnel no

# Specifies whether TCP forwarding is permitted.
# Denying it provides no real advantage unless shell access is also denied
AllowTcpForwarding {{ ssh_allow_tcp_forwarding }}

# Disable agent forwarding, since local agent could be accessed through forwarded connection.
# no real advantage without denied shell access
AllowAgentForwarding no

# Do not allow remote port forwardings to bind to non-loopback addresses.
GatewayPorts no

# Disable X11 forwarding, since local X11 display could be accessed through forwarded connection.
X11Forwarding no
X11UseLocalhost yes

# Only allow login for users from authorized groups
{% if ssh_permit_root_login == 'yes' or ssh_permit_root_login == 'without-password' %}
AllowGroups ssh sftponly git root
{% else %}
AllowGroups ssh sftponly git
{% endif %}

# Misc. configuration
# ===================

# Disable motd
PrintMotd no

# Disable printing last connections on login
PrintLastLog no

# file to send to the remote user before authentication
Banner none

#UseDNS yes
#PidFile /var/run/sshd.pid
#MaxStartups 10

# Enable compression
Compression yes

# Use reverse DNS lookups to validate authorized clients
# This allows using hostnames in auhtorized_keys instead of IP addresses
# The default is no
#UseDNS no

# print /etc/motd when a user logs in interactively
PrintMotd yes

# print the date and time of the last user login when a user logs in interactively
PrintLastLog yes

# SFTP configuration
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -l {{ ssh_sftp_loglevel }} -f LOCAL6

# User/group-specific configuration
# These lines must appear at the *end* of sshd_config

# Restrict members of the 'sftponly' group to SFTP subsystem,
# chroot them to their home directory
Match Group sftponly
ForceCommand internal-sftp -l {{ ssh_sftp_loglevel }} -f LOCAL6

AllowTcpForwarding no
