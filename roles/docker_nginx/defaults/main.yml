##### NGINX REVERSEPROXY CONTAINER #####

# A list of nginx servers (see example below). Each server requires:
# 'servername': domain name for which the server will handle requests.
# 'config': name of a nginx server config file/block. This file describes reverseproxy directives, ports, headers...
#           As this config is application-specific, roles must copy their own configuration to /etc/docker/services-config/nginx/$config.conf
# 'cert_mode': one of: 'selfsigned', 'ca'
#              If set to 'selfisgned', a self-signed certificate will be generated/configured in nginx.
#              If set to 'ca', the certificate/private key will be copied from secrets/$cert_filename.{crt,key} and configured in nginx
#              If set to 'letsencrypt', the certificate/key will be generated by Let's Encrypt/certbot and configured in nginx
# 'cert_filename: filename for the SSL certificate/key in /etc/ssl/{certs,private}/$cert_filename.{crt,key}
#                 If 'cert_mode' is set to 'ca', the original cert/key MUST exist in secrets/$cert_filename.{crt,key}
#                 If 'cert_mode' is set to selfsigned/letsencrypt, these files will be generated
#                 It is recommended to encrypt private keys with ansible-vault (ansible-vault encrypt my_key.key)
# 'htpasswd:'          (optional) yes/no (defaults to no): create a htpasswd file and bind-mount it in the container as '/etc/nginx/{{ servername }}.htpasswd
# 'htpasswd_user':     if 'htpasswd' is set to yes, username to register in the htpasswd file
# 'htpasswd_password': if 'htpasswd' is set to yes, password to register in the htpasswd file
# 'htpasswd_group': '  if 'htpasswd' is set to yes, group or GID to chgrp the file to (eg. 101 if the nginx process runs as UID 101)

# Example:
# nginx_servers:
#   # Server using a pre-generated certificate/key placed in secrets/ in the playbook directory
#   - servername: chat.example.com
#     config: rocketchat
#     cert_mode: ca
#     cert_filename: _.example.com
#     htpasswd: yes
#     htpasswd_user: "admin"
#     htpasswd_password: "hunter2"
#     htpasswd_group: "101"

# a list of network aliases to attach to the nginx service
# can be used to work around services inside the swarm calling the host's FQDN when no NAT loopback is enabled

# Example:
# nginx_docker_aliases:
#   - "chat.example.com"
#   - "webservice.example.com"

# (optional) e-mail address for registration on letsencrypt.org
#nginx_letsencrypt_email: "CHANGEME@example.org"

# (optional) Docker swarm node label required to run the service
# nginx_docker_label_constraint: nginx
