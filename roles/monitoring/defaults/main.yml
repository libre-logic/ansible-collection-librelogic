  - "CUST-0830" # Install debian-goodies so that you can run checkrestart (we use needrestart)
  - "BOOT-5122" # Password on GRUB bootloader to prevent altering boot configuration (access protected by physical security/hoster/hypervisor console password)
  - "AUTH-9286" # Configure minimum/maximum password age in /etc/login.defs (we don't enforce password aging)
  - "AUTH-9308" # No password set for single mode (access protected by physical security/hoster/hypervisor console password)
  - "FILE-6310" # place /tmp on a separated partition (root partition free disk space is monitored by netdata)
  - "TIME-3120" # Check ntpq peers output for unreliable ntp peers (we use a NTP pool, correct NTP peers wil be selected automatically)
  - "CONT-8104" # Run 'docker info' to see warnings applicable to Docker daemon (no swap support)
